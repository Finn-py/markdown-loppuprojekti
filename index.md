1. **Crack three eggs over a bowl**.

   > Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.
   >
   > If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. **Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl**.

   > Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. **Rub the salmon vigorously with butter**.

   > By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
4. **Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl**.

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
